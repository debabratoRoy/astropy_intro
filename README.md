Here have analyzed the fits file data of the NGC 1261 globular cluster taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The data was taken using ACS-WFC detector with F606W filter and 350s exposure time. From the data, I have located the apparent position of stars in a particular section of the cluster and calculated the magnitude of those stars. Through that project, I have learned the basics of how to handle fits file and use the data to analyze stars.
